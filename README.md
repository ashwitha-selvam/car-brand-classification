# Car-Brand-Classification
Deep-learning based application that will predict the brand of a car.

# What is this project about?
* I created this project to get started with **deep learning**. Specifically, how to predict classes using images via **Deep Learning**.
* I have used the concept of *transfer learning*. Transfer learning is a deep learning method, where a model developed previously for a task, is reused as the starting point for a model on a secondary task. More about transfer-learning



# Dataset used:
Dataset is provided in the repository itself.
